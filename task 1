解释器
An interpreter is a program that reads and executes code.
A compiler simply converts the source code into machine code, which can be run directly by the operating system as an executable program. Interpreters bypass the compilation process and execute the code directly.
## 2.python初体验
```python
print(1,2) # print 1 2
print("1" "2") # print 12
print("1","2") # print 1 2
print("hello","world",sep",") #split string using ","

input = input("Enter a word or a number: ") #输入数据都作为字符串接收
input = int(input("Enter a number: ")) # Convert string to int
```
### 3.python基础讲解
python变量特性+命名规则

variables:
1. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
2. Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have been set.
3. String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes.

rules:
1. Variables names must start with a letter or an underscore.
2. The remainder of your variable name may consist of letters, numbers and underscores.
3. Names are case sensitive.

注释方法
```python
# using # to comment a single line
input = input("Enter your name: ") #get user's name

# using ''' or """ can comment multiple lines
"""
  @version: 3.7
  @author: zoe
  ...
"""
```
python中“：”作用

- As slice operator with sequence:
```python
a=[1,2,3,4,5]
>>> a[1:3]
>>> [2, 3]
```
- start an indent suite of statements in case of if, while, for, def and class statements.
```python
while expr:
   stmt1
   stmt2
```

学会使用dir( )及和help( )
- The dir() function returns all properties and methods of the specified object, without the values.This function will return all the properties and methods, even built-in properties which are default for all object.
```python
dir(obj)
```
- The python help function is used to display the documentation of modules, functions, classes, keywords etc.
```python
help([obj])
```
import使用
using import to use modules we created.
```python
import myname
myname.hello("zoe")

def hello(name):
  print("Hello, " + name)
```

pep8介绍
- PEP 8 is Python's style guide. It's a set of rules for how to format your Python code to maximize its readability.
#### 4.python数值基本知识
python中数值类型，int，float，bool，e记法等
算数运算符
```python
# Addition
x + y
# Subtraction
x - y
# Multiplication
x * y
#Division
x / y
# Modulus
x % y
# Exponentiation
x ** y
# Floor division
x // y
```
逻辑运算符
```python
# and
# Returns True if both statements are true
x < 5 and  x < 10

# or
# Returns True if one of the statements is true
x < 5 or x < 4

# not
# Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true
not(x < 5 and x < 10)
```
成员运算符
```python
#in
# Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object
x in y
#not in
# Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object
x not in y
```
身份运算符
```python
# is 
# Returns true if both variables are the same object
x is y
# is not
# Returns true if both variables are not the same object
x is not y
```
